# About this repository.

The goal of this repository is to have many projects that can be used to practice when learning C programming.
For now, the projects will be mostly for beginners, maybe intermediate (not likely) programmers because I am a beginner myself.
Each project will have a **readme.md** file which will provide more information on the specific project.

That is all for now.
