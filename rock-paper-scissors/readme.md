# Rock Paper Scissors
This is the classic rock paper scissors game. The rules are as you know
them; rock beats scissors, paper beats rock and scissors beats paper.
You choose by writing the first letter of your choice i.e. if rock,
then write `r` and so on.
The computer will then randomly choose and display the results.
