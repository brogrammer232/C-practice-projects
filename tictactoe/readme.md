# TicTacToe
You play as `X` and the computer plays as `O`.
To play this game, enter the number of the cell you want to play in.
The cell at the topleft corner is `1` and that at the bottomright corner
is `9`.

The computer plays in a random empty cell, it is not thinking in any way.
When there is a winner, the game ends and the winner is announced.
Check out the demonstration video.
